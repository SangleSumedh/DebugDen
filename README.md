# 🐞 DebugDen — A Safe Haven for Stuck Devs and Code Sleuths

Welcome to **DebugDen**: Not your grandma’s Stack Overflow.  
It’s for devs, by devs, with an AI sidekick who works for snacks (and sometimes gives questionable advice).

- **Stuck?** Drop your bug — someone (or AI) might just save your day.  
- **Just watching?** Lurk all you want.  
- **In the mood to flex?** Write answers, climb the karma ladder 🪜.

## 🚀 What Makes DebugDen Different?

- **Ask & Answer Freely**  
  Stack Overflow vibes without the “please read the docs first” police.  

- **Supercharged Search**  
  Find threads, solutions, or just weird code tangents in seconds.  

- **Dev-First UI**  
  Built with React, Tailwind, and dark mode for sensitive eyes.  

- **⚡ AI Sidekick (Now Live!)**  
  Stuck at 3AM? Tap the *AI Answer* button and let our bot give you a “Created by AI” response.  
  (Sometimes gold, sometimes chaos, always honest.)  

- **Live Feedback (Coming Soon...)**  
  Karma now, validation later.

## 🧠 The Tech Under the Hood

| Layer    | Tech                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | React, Tailwind, React Router             |
| Backend  | Appwrite (swap in your own, YOLO)         |
| AI       | OpenRouter (GPT / Gemini) ⚡ (AI Answers!) |
| Hosting  | Vercel                                    |

## 🤔 Why OpenRouter Instead of Just Gemini?

- **Flexibility** → Route requests to GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or Gemini with one API.  
- **Budget-friendly** → Works with your student-level budget.  
- **No more lock-in** → If Gemini is down, GPT steps in.
