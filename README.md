# 🐞 DebugDen — A Safe Haven for Stuck Devs and Code Sleuths

Welcome to **DebugDen**: Not your grandma’s Stack Overflow.  
 It’s for devs, by devs, with an AI sidekick who works for snacks (and sometimes gives questionable advice).

- **Stuck?** Drop your bug — someone (or AI) might just save your day.
- **Just watching?** Lurk all you want.
- **In the mood to flex?** Write answers, climb the karma ladder 🪜.

## 🚀 What Makes DebugDen Different?

- **Ask & Answer Freely**  
  Stack Overflow vibes without the “please read the docs first” police.

- **Gemini AI in Your Corner**  
  Sometimes smart, sometimes wild-card, always fast.

- **Supercharged Search**  
  Find threads, solutions, or just weird code tangents in seconds.

- **Dev-First UI**  
  Built with React, Tailwind, and dark mode for sensitive eyes.

- **Live Feedback (Coming Soon...)**  
  For those who like their karma instant.

| -------- | ---------------------------------- |

| Hosting  | Vercel / Netlify / Local           |

## 🤔 Why Gemini and Not OpenAI or any other AI?

A few reasons:

- It’s **free** right now (be honest, so is your budget).
- Needs only a **Google Cloud account** + billing setup (they won’t charge unless you go wild).
- Perfect for **students, hobbyists**, and rebels.
